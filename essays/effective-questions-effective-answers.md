It is crucial when communicating online that one is straightforward in order to avoid preventable misunderstandings or confusion. When masked behind the facade of a screen, we often lack important social cues such as tone of voice, body language, and facial expressions that indicate extra information to the listener. Although the power of online chatting has permitted us to talk to anyone, anywhere in the world, it is missing the real-time feedback needed to converse which can lead to misguided judgment. Hence this is why one needs to be “smart” when asking questions on an online platform or forum that is shared with the public. By being comprehensive, contextually transparent, and providing additional levels of clarity to an issue, the results of replies are drastically improved. 

Since there is a plethora of readily available information to read about online, many users can find the solution to their query very quickly. However, in the world of software engineering, looking for hyper-specific answers can be proven to be problematic based on the individualistic nature of the issue being solved. This is where being clear and concise with the style of question can be beneficial in terms of receiving well-thought-out feedback. For example, a user on Stack Overflow inquires about certain errors that they are receiving in their hypertext preprocessor (PHP) script. They note that before approaching the forums, they had not received any problems before and that this was a sudden issue while also providing the exact error names. In addition, this person also includes the lines of code where the error is indicated to provide further context into the question they are asking.
What the user pasted into their question:
```
echo "My variable value is: " . $my_variable_name;
echo "My index value is: " . $my_array["my_index"];
```
Instead of inquiring about open-ended questions, this user employs a “smart” way of approaching inquiries by looking for the meaning, why the sudden appearance, and how they can resolve the problem. What this individual does effectively is provide all the contextual evidence for their issue and also be direct with what they desire from the answers.

While face-to-face conversations are driven by unsaid social cues, much can be said the same for online etiquette as well. As mentioned before, since we can not clearly see or hear emotions being alluded to, how one phrases an online statement or query can drastically change based on vocabulary and clarity. In stark contrast to the first user, I will point to another person using the Stack Overflow platform less effectively. This figure simply just states that they are developing an app that crashes upon being run with a certain message popping up. In juxtaposition with the first person, this second user does not specify what program they are using nor do they provide any snippets of their code in order to pinpoint the issue. Although their question tags do provide a little bit more information and context clues, their query is at most two sentences long and ends with a simple question of how they can fix it without knowing what exactly needs to be addressed.

How one approaches advice online can be employed in different ways as explored above. The overall effect of this is how others respond to these two types of questions. The first user garnered a variety of replies that answered all of their questions effectively with many of them even having examples to further explain the concept to them. These responses tended to be lengthy which supported the person’s learning and level of understanding. With the second individual, they also received a multitude of solutions to their question but it mainly involved narrowing down the specifics of the issue at hand first and then giving suggestions on how to fix it. Had the second user done more research and looked at the console for the particular error that they were receiving, they could have received more information on resolution like with the first person. Next time when you want to approach strangers on the internet for advice or answers, make sure to be mindful of the method you ask.
