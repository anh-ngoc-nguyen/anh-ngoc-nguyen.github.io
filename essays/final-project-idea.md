# SkillSwap
By Anh Nguyen and Yuna Soo

# Overview
## The Problem
Many UHM students have talents or skills that are undervalued but can have monetary gain. A good portion of the student population are either working part-time jobs or are always finding ways to make money. 
## The Solution
"SkillSwap" is an app created by Anh Nguyen and Yuna Soo that helps tackle this problem by creating a common hub for students to offer up their skills to others. Students can create profiles listing their talents but also things they may need in return, this way they are able to negotiate each other for goods.
