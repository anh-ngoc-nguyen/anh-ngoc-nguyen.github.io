# SkillSwap
By Anh Nguyen and Yuna Soo

<hr>

# Overview
## The Problem
Many UHM students have talents or skills that are undervalued but can have monetary gain. A good portion of the student population are either working part-time jobs or are always finding ways to make money. 
## The Solution
"SkillSwap" is an app created by Anh Nguyen and Yuna Soo that helps tackle this problem by creating a common hub for students to offer up their skills to others. Students can create profiles listing their talents but also things they may need in return, this way they are able to negotiate each other for goods.

# Mockup Pages
On its own, "SkillSwap" will have a few mockup pages to get the user situated with the basics and purpose of the website:
- Landing Page: Introduction to SkillSwap with account login/signup
- Explore Page: Explore other users' skills and offers
- Profile Page: Users can list their skills and what theyâ€™re looking for
- Messaging Page: Chat functionality for users to contacting
- Dashboard: Overview of current swaps, feedback, work in progress

# Use Cases
While the title of the software is straightforward here are a few use cases we anticipate for our app:
- New user goes to landing page, reads info about website, signs up for a free account, create their own profile, explore others' skills and contacts them
- Old user goes to landing page, logs in, check dashboard to see progression of their service, go to messages, communicate with service provider

# Beyond the Basics
To enhance the user experience, we have some other features to offer up on "SkillSwap":
- Review feature out of 5 stars to ensure quality control
- Find people with mutual SkillSwappers
- Each profile will have a "portfolio" to showcase their previous works
