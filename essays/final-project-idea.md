# SkillSwap
By Anh Nguyen and Yuna Soo

<hr>

# Overview
## The Problem
Many UHM students have talents or skills that are undervalued but can have monetary gain. A good portion of the student population at the University of Hawai'i at Mānoa are either working part-time jobs or are always finding ways to make money. Those who especially live on or near campus may not have readibly available access to specific tools or resources to remedy their issue. 
## The Solution
"SkillSwap" is an app created by Anh Nguyen and Yuna Soo that helps tackle this problem by creating a common hub for students to offer up their skills to others. Students can create profiles listing their talents but also things they may need in return, this way they are able to negotiate each other for goods. Users can choose to either sell or trade their skills based on these profiles as this app advertises services in a close and convenient proximity.

# Mockup Pages
On its own, "SkillSwap" will have a few mockup pages to get the user situated with the basics and purpose of the website:
- Landing Page: Introduction to SkillSwap with account login/signup
- Explore Page: Explore other users' skills and offers
- Profile Page: Users can list their skills and what they’re looking for
- Messaging Page: Chat functionality for users to contacting
- Dashboard: Overview of current swaps, feedback, work in progress
With each of these pages, they make up the core foundations for our application. As the Landing Page guides new and returning users, the Explore Page is where all of the discovery happens. The Explore Page is built up through profiles curated through the Profile Page. Once a user confirms their selection, they can contact others through the Messaging Page where they use the Dashboard to keep track of current exchanges.

# Use Cases
While the title of the software is straightforward here are a few use cases we anticipate for our app:
- New user goes to landing page, reads info about website, signs up for a free account, create their own profile, explore others' skills and contacts them
- Old user goes to landing page, logs in, check dashboard to see progression of their service, go to messages, communicate with service provider
This is the general idea of how we envision our website from both a new and returning user perspective from start to finish. It is designed to be a seamless and similar experience every time regardless of who's using it.

# Beyond the Basics
To enhance the user experience, we have some other features to offer up on "SkillSwap":
- Review feature out of 5 stars to ensure quality control
- Find people with mutual SkillSwappers
- Each profile will have a "portfolio" to showcase their previous works
By having these extra aspects, its helps our student userbase narrow down their choices through classifications. Some users may be picky with their decisions, wants, or needs.
